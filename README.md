# Overview
Cancer is a deadly illness that effects countless around the world. One aspect in cancer research is understanding mitosis (cell reproduction). This helps us understand the intensity of the cancer in a certain sample.

# Segmentation
Segmentation is the concept of splitting up individual objects in a given image. We used the CellPose library and adjusted parameters in order to separate individual cells in a given sample.

# Morphometry
This idea is related to identifying specific shapes and cutting out slices to make observations. Our TensorFlow model was used on several samples to identify which cells are undergoing mitosis.
